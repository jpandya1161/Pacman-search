Welcome to Pacman

After downloading the code (search.zip), unzipping it, and changing to the directory, you should
be able to play a game of Pacman by typing the following at the command line:
python pacman.py
Note: The exact command you should be using depends on your distribution and python
installation.
Pacman lives in a shiny blue world of twisting corridors and tasty round treats. Navigating this
world efficiently will be Pacmanâ€™s first step in mastering his domain.
The simplest agent in searchAgents.py is called the GoWestAgent, which always goes West (a
trivial reflex agent). This agent can occasionally win:
python pacman.py --layout testMaze --pacman GoWestAgent
But, things get ugly for this agent when turning is required:
python pacman.py --layout tinyMaze --pacman GoWestAgent
If Pacman gets stuck, you can exit the game by typing CTRL-c into your terminal.
Soon, your agent will solve not only tinyMaze, but any maze you want.
Note that pacman.py supports a number of options that can each be expressed in a long way (e.g.,
--layout) or a short way (e.g., -l). You can see the list of all options and their default values via:
python pacman.py -h
